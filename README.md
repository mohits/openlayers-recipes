# OpenLayers Recipes

This is a collection of pages that show how to do some things using OpenLayers. It's just a collection of things for me to remember how to do these things and to have a set of pages that can be put into GitHub for people to access and use by themselves.

The code accompanies posts in my [blog](https://notepad.onghu.com/) and so, the descriptions, if any, are available there. This is not an actively and frequently updated collection. It is only updated when I do some work with maps and choose to document a way to remember it.

All the files are under `site` with each demonstration being in its own HTML page. The pages use the OpenLayers hosted build (for development) to reduce the number of things included here. If additional assets are needed, they will be under the `css` (for styles), `js` (for Javascript) and `img` (for images).
